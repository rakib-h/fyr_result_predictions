# Final Year Result Predictions using deep learning
The academic result is most important for a student in their career. This result depends on their academic performance and many other factors. Educational data mining can helps both students and institutions to develop their academic performances. For analysis of their performance, we can use new techniques Deep Learning, Convolution Neural Network, Data clustering, Optimization algorithm etc. in machine learning. Using Deep Learning, we will predict student's yearly performance in the form of CGPA and compared that with real CGPA. A real dataset can boost the prediction performances. We used a real dataset from the Institute of Science, Trade, and Technology (ISTT)
